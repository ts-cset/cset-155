# Public Library Data

- Look over the [Data Dictionary](https://www.imls.gov/sites/default/files/fy2014_pls_data_file_documentation.pdf) to understand the columns, data types, and values
- Download [2014 Survey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthonydb/practical-sql/master/Chapter_08/pls_fy2014_pupld14a.csv) data
- Download [2009 Survey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthonydb/practical-sql/master/Chapter_08/pls_fy2009_pupld09a.csv) data

.fourteen[Use Listing 8-1 and Listing 8-2 to create and import both tables.]

---

# Public Library Data

Notes:
- .eight[fscskey] is unique to each library, so it's a perfect natural primary key
- Many of the columns have the .eight[NOT NULL] constraint because they were required answers in the survey.
- The CSV has a column named .eight[database] but that's a SQL keyword, so we had to rename it.
- Some columns, like .eight[startdat] and .eight[enddat] contain dates, but we have to use the .eight[varchar] type because of missing values.

name: count

# Counting Rows

How many rows are in these tables?

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a;

SELECT count(*)
FROM pls_fy2009_pupld09a;
```

The asterisk acts as a wildcard, so a row will count regardless of .eight[NULL] values.

---

# Counting Values

How many rows have values in a certain column?

```sql
SELECT count(salaries)
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a;
```

Only .eight[5,983] out of .eight[9,305] libraries reported salary info.

Use this check to evaluate how thorough your analysis is.

---

# Counting Distinct Values

```sql
SELECT count(libname)
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a;

SELECT count(DISTINCT libname)
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a;
```

The first matches the total number of rows which makes sense: each library should have a name.

.fourteen[Does the second make sense?]

---
name: min-max

# Finding Min/Max Values

```sql
SELECT max(visits), min(visits)
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a;
```

.fourteen[How can a library have negative visits?]

---

# Finding Min/Max Values

A common convention is to use "nonsense" values in a column that fit the data type as a code for specific meanings.

For this survey:
- .eight[-1] means the library didn't answer the question
- .eight[-3] means the column isn't applicable to the library

.eleven[A better way is to separate the value and info about the value into separate column.]

---
name: group

# Aggregate Using Groups

On it's own .eight[GROUP BY] looks just like .eight[DISTINCT]:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT stabr
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a
ORDER BY stabr;

SELECT stabr
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a
GROUP BY stabr
ORDER BY stabr;
```

.fourteen[So why use GROUP BY?]

---

# Aggregate Using Groups

```sql
SELECT stabr, count(*)
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a
GROUP BY stabr
ORDER BY count(stabr) DESC;
```

If you SELECT individual columns with an aggregate function, you .eleven[must] include those columns in the GROUP BY clause.

---

# Group Using Multiple Columns

```sql
SELECT stabr, stataddr, count(*)
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a
GROUP BY stabr, stataddr
ORDER BY stabr ASC, count(*) DESC;
```

stataddr values:
- .eight[00] = No address change
- .eight[07] = Moved to new address
- .eight[15] = Minor address change

---
name: sum

# Revisiting Sum

```sql
SELECT sum(visits) AS visits_2014
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a
WHERE visits &gt;= 0;

SELECT sum(visits) AS visits_2009
FROM pls_fy2009_pupld09a
WHERE visits &gt;= 0;
```

But we know there's a different number of rows in each table, so let's get a better comparison...

---

# Revisiting Sum

```sql
SELECT sum(pls14.visits) AS visits_2014,
       sum(pls09.visits) AS visits_2009
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a pls14 JOIN pls_fy2009_pupld09a pls09
ON pls14.fscskey = pls09.fscskey
WHERE pls14.visits &gt;= 0 AND pls09.visits &gt;= 0;
```

Okay, so library visits are still dropping for the US as a whole, but how about a state by state comparison?

---

# Putting It All Together

```sql
SELECT pls14.stabr,
       sum(pls14.visits) AS visits_2014,
       sum(pls09.visits) AS visits_2009,
       round( (CAST(sum(pls14.visits) AS decimal(10,1)) - sum(pls09.visits)) /
                    sum(pls09.visits) * 100, 2 ) AS pct_change
FROM pls_fy2014_pupld14a pls14 JOIN pls_fy2009_pupld09a pls09
ON pls14.fscskey = pls09.fscskey
WHERE pls14.visits &gt;= 0 AND pls09.visits &gt;= 0
GROUP BY pls14.stabr
ORDER BY pct_change DESC;
```

# Filter Aggregate Query Results

.eight[WHERE] filters by row in the table, .eight[HAVING] filters by group results.

```sql
-- ...
-- GROUP BY pls14.stabr
HAVING sum(pls14.visits) &gt; 50000000
-- ORDER BY pct_change DESC;
```

---

# .fourteen[Exercises]

Library visits have declined, but what about use of technology? Modify the previous two queries to use two different columns:

- .eight[gpterms] - number of internet-connected computers for public use
- .eight[pitusr] - number of uses for these computers

Can you find the percent change in the sum of each column over time?

---

# .fourteen[Exercises]

Both tables contain a column called .eight[obereg], a two-digit code for region. Just like we calculated percent change of visits grouped by state, do the same grouped by region.

Look at the survey's documentation to figure out what the regions are.

---

# .fourteen[Exercises]

Let's not forget how to use joins!

Write a query that will show all the rows in both tables, including those without matches, and add an .eight[IS NULL] filter to show agencies not included in one table or the other.
